export const HERO_CONTENT = `My name is Kunal Singh, and I am a full-stack developer based in Bihar with three years of hands-on experience in the IT industry. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Applications from the Central University of Haryana, which I completed in 2021.

I specialize in building fast, reliable, and user-friendly web applications. On the frontend, I use React.js and Next.js to create engaging and responsive user interfaces. On the backend, I work with Node.js to develop scalable and efficient server-side functionalities.

Over the course of my career, I’ve developed strong expertise in component-based architecture with React, managing complex application logic, and optimizing performance for seamless user experiences. I’ve contributed to a range of projects, including e-commerce platforms and learning management systems, which have enhanced my ability to deliver intuitive and high-quality digital solutions.

My experience allows me to handle both frontend and backend development effectively—from designing robust backend architectures to implementing dynamic and interactive frontend features. I continuously stay up to date with emerging technologies to ensure my work is modern, innovative, and aligned with industry standards.`;
